# I2C Encoder Mini Source Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

Here you can find the source code of the I2C Encoder Mini.
For developing the FW I have use the Atmel Studio 7.0 and the code is written in C.
For programming I have used the PICkit 4, the INT pin of the board is the UPDI port and can be used for programming/debugging

There are also the compiled FW ready to be downloaded in the ATtiny 402
